title: My first week at Metis in San Francisco
---

Data Science enables businesses to make better decisions faster â€“ that's why I was very excited to start into the 3-months, full-time immersive Data Science Bootcamp at Metis in San Francisco last week. 

After more than two years working as a Management Consultant at Bain, it was a bit of a change to come back to school, listen to lectures and hand in weekly assignments again. However, it has been great so far! Our cohort is awesome with interesting people from lots of different backgrounds, our instructors seem very competent and are extremely helpful and everything around the Bootcamp is very well organized. 
Most importantly, it also feels like we learnt a lot during the first week:

 - Set-up and maintenance of our own repos on github
 - Data exploration using Pandas
 - First data visualization techniques using matplot and seaborn
 - Working from the command line

The learning during the bootcamp is organized in a very efficient way along four main pillars: (1) To deepen our python skills, every morning starts with pair programming which is great as it enables us to learn from one another. (2) Afterwards, we have lectures on new concepts that are then directly applied in (3) challenges that we work on during the afternoon or at home. Moreover, we get to do (4) projects that we eventually have to present in front of the class.

The first week's project was on turnstile data from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in New York that is openly available at http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html. In groups of four we had to come up with an idea on how to use the available data and pitch it to a potential buyer (represented by the class) during an 8-minute presentation at the end of the week.

Our background research revealed that the MTA often shuts down entire stations for a couple of months to do renovations. These shut downs disrupt the customers' experience and reduce revenues for the MTA. Therefore, we came up with the idea that the MTA might get around closing down stations (or can close them for a shorter period of time) if they would do the renovations of stations during times with little food traffic in the respective stations.
Hence, our team decided to analyze the data to find the best times to do renovations in the subway stations during the week by identifying the times with the least foot traffic. As one might have guessed, the times of lowest traffic were on weekends as well as during the week at night and around midday.
